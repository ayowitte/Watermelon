My project is about the average sleeping times of different age groups.
I have implemented a simple menu for the User to navigate through the diagrams.
I have also added music that can be paused and resumed and also a gif so my program doesn't look to simple.
Another small feauture that i have added is that evertime the program is started, the graphs are different colours which provides diversity.
I imported the ControlP5 library and have used it in my menu.
