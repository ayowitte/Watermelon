My project is about sleep deprivation and the consequences thereof.
Currently i have data about reaction speed in relation to sleep deprivation but i want to gradually gather more data.
I'd like to make a User Interface that allows the User to easily use a Menu to choose what data they want to view.
The data will then be displayed to the User in a "unique" way.
My aim is to give the User as much information about a specific consequence as possible which will require reading in more csv files.
